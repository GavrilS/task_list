# task_list

This is a project to create a task list with python 'flask'.

- Covered concepts so far:

  - create the Flask app
  - routing, render_template, request methods and url_for
  - templating(Jinja) / static files for the CSS
  - SQLAlchemy for db with mysqlconnector driver
  - added secret key so the session can be used
  - need to create mysql user to connect to the project(or give privileges to all accounts on the system to use the current user)
  - blueprints and views?
    - register/login a user
    - create/update/delete tasks(will use the form with post methods to cover the different actions for create/update/delete -> WIP)

- Next steps:
  - add the html/css for the different pages and visualize the data
  - test build functionality so far
  - test coverage
  - make the project installable?
